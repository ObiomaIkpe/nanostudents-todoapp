### there are two types of errors
1. operational errors
- expected problems, eg invalid path accessed, failed to connect to server/db, invalid user input, etc
2. programming errors
- bugs that we developers bring into our code. eg, reading properties on undefined variables, passing a number when an object is expected, using await without async, using req.query instead of req.body
