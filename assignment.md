1. write 2 paragraphs on the 5 types of middlewares in express. each paragraph should not have anything less than 20 words. 
- each type of middleware should also have code examples (in addition to the 20 words).

2. create a basic express server and put the following middlewares (as application level middlewares)
- a middleware that logs the current time to the console everytime the home route is accessed.
- a middleware that logs "hello" to the console everytime the home route is accessed.

create routes in a separate file and import it in your index.js file as a middleware.

##### make sure that your server works.
